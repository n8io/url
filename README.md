# `@n8io/url`

üåê A tiny library that is meant to be a drop in replacement for the native `URL` class with some extra functionality to hydrate route and search parameters.

## Basic Usage

```ts
import { URL } from '@n8io/url'

const url = new URL(
  '/',
  apiUrl, 
  {
    pathname: '/users/:username/repos',
    // Based on the pathname üëÜ...
    // the route params are type checked üëá 
    routeParams: { username: 'n8io' },
    searchParams,
  }
)
```

## Getting Started

```shell
pnpm install @n8io/url
```

## API

This library provides the following utility functions:

- [`URL`](#url) - A drop in replacement for the native `URL` interface, supercharged with route and search parameter hydration
- [`hydrateRoute(route, params, options?)`](#hydrateroute) - Given a route (e.g. `/dogs/:breed`), hydrate the route with a **type safe** route params object (e.g. `{ breed: 'pug' }`)
- [`hydrateSearchParams(route, params, options?)`](hydreatesearchparams) - Given a route, hydrate the route's search parameters via a plain old javascript object (e.g. `{ utm_source: 'facebook' }`) while respecting existing values.

### `URL`

> Why is this even needed? Doesn't the native `URL` give us all the tools we need?

The [`URL`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL) and [`URLSearchParams`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URLSearchParams) apis are great and they provide us with all of the tools needed to manipulate urls. However the constructor for a new URL is quite rigid (`new URL(url: string, base?: string)`). 

This library's `URL` function provides a more ergonomic api for generating a URL from route and search parameters.

#### Example

##### Given the following...

```ts
const githubApiUrl = 'https://api.github.com/'

const routes = {
  USER_REPOSITORIES: '/users/:username/repos',
  // ...
}

const routeParams = { username: 'n8io' }

const searchParams = {
  page: 1,
  per_page: 25,
  sort: 'name',
  direction: 'asc',
}
```

##### Via native `URL` api...

```ts
const route = routes.REPOSITORY.replace(':username', routeParams.username)
const url = new URL(route, githubApiUrl)

url.searchParams.set('page', search.page.toString())
url.searchParams.set('pageSize', search.pageSize.toString())
url.searchParams.set('sort', 'name')
url.searchParams.set('sortBy', 'asc')
```

It may not be immediately clear, but this approach's developer experience is "Just OK"‚Ñ¢Ô∏è for the following reasons:

- ü§¢ Find/replacing keys with values is error prone:
  -  Relies on magic string keys, typos will happen
  -  Low readability
- üëé Need to stringify values for search params

##### Via `url`...

```ts
import { URL } from '@n8io/url'

const url = new URL(
  '/', 
  githubApiUrl, 
  {
    pathname: '/users/:username/repos',
    // Based on the pathname üëÜ...
    // the route params are type checked üëá 
    routeParams,
    searchParams,
  }
)

console.log(url.href) // https://api.github.com/users/n8io/repos?page=1&pageSize=25&sort=name&sortBy=asc
```

Look at those ergonomics üî•!
